            there aren't enough online platforms or resources for practicing
            multiple-choice questions (MCQs). students must buy a solution book or
            depend on old questions only. Hence, To solve this problem we came up

            challenges faced by students in finding and practicing MCQs. In each
            semester, there may be about 50-100 questions with are updated and added
            from time to time. Also, All questions will strictly follow the syllabus
